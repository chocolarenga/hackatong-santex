Now I need to check the package.json to understand the dependencies used in the project:

Read file: package.json
Based on the code exploration, I now understand the current state of the application:

1. It's a React application using Typescript, Vite, and Shadcn/UI components
2. The current functionality is focused on:
   - Setting up API keys (Deepgram for audio transcription, Gemini for summarization)
   - Recording or uploading audio files of medical consultations
   - Transcribing the audio using Deepgram
   - Generating two types of summaries using Gemini AI:
     - A patient-friendly summary
     - A technical medical summary

3. Current pages:
   - Setup: For configuring API keys and AI prompts
   - Notes: For recording/uploading consultations and viewing transcriptions/summaries

Now I'll create a comprehensive implementation plan to match the mockups and requirements shown in the images.

Let me create a more detailed breakdown of the first phases, which should be implemented first:

## Detailed Phase 1 Implementation Plan

### 1. Update Application Structure

1. **Create New Routes in App.tsx**
   - Update the routing structure to include all new pages
   - Implement route protection where necessary

```typescript
// New routes to add
<Route path="/dashboard" element={<Dashboard />} />
<Route path="/appointments" element={<Appointments />} />
<Route path="/appointment/:id" element={<AppointmentDetail />} />
<Route path="/history" element={<History />} />
<Route path="/consultation/:id" element={<ConsultationDetail />} />
<Route path="/chat" element={<Chat />} />
<Route path="/emergency" element={<Emergency />} />
<Route path="/profile" element={<Profile />} />
```

2. **Create Placeholder Pages**
   - Implement basic structure for each new page
   - Include navigation components
   - Set up the layout structure

3. **Navigation Components**
   - Build the bottom navigation bar shown in the mockups
   - Include Chat, Consultations, QRs, and Profile icons
   - Implement active state styling

### 2. Design System Alignment

1. **Update Color Scheme and Typography**
   - Update `tailwind.config.ts` with the color scheme from mockups
   - Define typography styles to match the design
   - Create custom component variants where needed

2. **Header Component**
   - Create a reusable header with the user's name
   - Include appointment status information
   - Implement the profile avatar component

3. **Card Components**
   - Design appointment cards
   - Create consultation summary cards
   - Implement the user profile card

### 3. Data Model Extension

1. **Update the Note Type**
   - Extend the data model to include all fields needed for the new features

```typescript
export interface Doctor {
  id: string;
  name: string;
  specialty: string;
  institution?: string;
}

export interface Appointment {
  id: string;
  doctorId: string;
  date: string;
  time: string;
  status: 'scheduled' | 'completed' | 'cancelled';
  location?: string;
  notes?: string;
}

// Enhanced Note type
export interface Note {
  id: string;
  title: string;
  date: string;
  doctorId: string;
  appointmentId?: string;
  doctorName: string;
  specialty: string;
  institution?: string;
  location?: string;
  symptoms: string[];
  diagnosis: string;
  treatment: string;
  medications: string[];
  followUp: string;
  recommendations: string[];
  questions: string[];
  audioBlob: Blob;
  transcription: string;
  patientSummary: string;
  medicalSummary: string;
  attachments: Attachment[];
}

export interface Attachment {
  id: string;
  name: string;
  type: string;
  url: string;
  blob: Blob;
}

export interface EmergencyInfo {
  fullName: string;
  age: number;
  bloodType: string;
  allergies: string[];
  conditions: string[];
  medications: string[];
  emergencyContact: {
    name: string;
    relationship: string;
    phone: string;
  };
}
```

2. **Create Mock Data**
   - Implement mock data for testing the UI components
   - Create a data service layer for managing state

3. **Local Storage Management**
   - Extend the local storage operations to handle new data types
   - Implement proper data serialization/deserialization

## Detailed Phase 2 Implementation Plan

### 1. Dashboard Implementation

1. **Create Dashboard Component**
   - Implement welcome banner with user info
   - Build upcoming appointments section
   - Create quick action buttons

2. **Upcoming Appointments Widget**
   - Build appointment card component
   - Add appointment time formatting
   - Implement navigation to appointment details

### 2. Appointments Management

1. **Appointment List Page**
   - Create list view of all upcoming appointments
   - Implement filtering and sorting capabilities
   - Add search functionality

2. **Appointment Creation Form**
   - Build form for creating new appointments
   - Include doctor selection
   - Add date and time pickers
   - Implement form validation

3. **Appointment Detail View**
   - Create detailed view of selected appointment
   - Add options to edit or cancel appointment
   - Include reminder settings

### Summary of Priority Order

Based on the UI mockups and the current implementation, I recommend implementing the features in this order:

1. **First Priority**: Update core UI and navigation to match mockups
2. **Second Priority**: Implement appointment management features
3. **Third Priority**: Enhance consultation recording and detail views
4. **Fourth Priority**: Implement file attachment functionality
5. **Fifth Priority**: Add chat interface for querying medical information
6. **Sixth Priority**: Create emergency QR code feature
7. **Seventh Priority**: Implement security features and polish

This approach ensures that we start with the foundational UI changes and core features, and then progressively add more complex functionality. Each phase builds upon the previous work, allowing for iterative development and testing.
